Histologically, the cells are small, round, and have fine, delicate, eosinophilic cytoplasm. They form nests or sheets. There may be a central \"nuclear zone\" containing large nuclei, which may have a bizarre appearance. A translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 is seen in most cases.

These vitamins play an essential role in DNA synthesis and red blood cell maturation, and they are needed for proper function of the methionine synthase enzyme. Deficiencies can be due to dietary deficiency, malabsorption, and reduced synthesis.Megaloblastic anemias may also be caused by drugs and alcohol abuse, some types of cancer, and genetic disorders, including Fanconi anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.Megaloblastic anemia results from impaired maturation of red blood cells.

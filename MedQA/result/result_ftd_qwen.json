Negligence of duty by a relative or friend who has taken upon himself responsibility for the maintenance of the aggrieved woman or her child.\n5. Refusal to allow the widow to remarry after dissolution of marriage by death of her husband.\n6. Sexual harassment.\n\nIPC Section 498A\nExplanation: It is not necessary that the husband must have been guilty of some criminal act or gross misconduct before filing a suit under this provision. In fact, it provides protection even when there is no proof of criminal conduct on the part of the husband. This provision enables a wife to sue without having to prove that she had suffered injury from the acts complained of; but if the wife proves that she was actually injured by the acts complained of, then the liability of the husband will increase.\nIn order to succeed in a suit under this section, the wife need only show that she has been subjected to \"cruelty\" within the meaning of the proviso to the section.\nThe word \"cruelty\" is very wide and includes all kinds of ill-treatment, however slight. The term does not mean mere insults, though these may sometimes accompany the abuse. If the wife suffers from actual physical pain, mental torture or distress caused by unreasonable action or omission, it constitutes cruelty.\nRef : K.D TRIPATHI Vol II Pg - 784", "Correct option": "A"}

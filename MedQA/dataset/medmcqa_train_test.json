Primary tuberculosis infection characteristically involves the lung subjacent to the pleura in either the lower pa of the upper lobe or the upper pa of a lower lobe of one lung. The mediastinal nodes are also usually involved , rather than having a single lesion subjacent to the pleura without lymph node involvement. However, the \"trick\" pa of this question rests on the fact that roughly 80% of newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis cases in adults are actually due to reactivation of an often clinically unsuspected infection acquired years-to-decades previously. The reinfection site usually is in the apex of the lung. You should also be aware that the lungs are not the only site where tuberculosis can occur (it can occur throughout the body), and isolated gastrointestinal involvement is (uncommonly) also seen.

{"input": "Essential for tumour metastasis is ?\nOptions:\nA) Angiogenesis\nB) Tumorogenesis\nC) Apoptosis\nD) Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity", "Analysis": "Angiogenesis Tumour angiogenesis plays a very significant role in the metastasis since the new vessel formed as a pa of growing tumour are more vulnerable to invasion because these evolving cells are in direct contact with cancer cells. According to Harrison \"Cancer research studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the, growth of a new network of blood vessels called tumour angiogenesis\". Angiogenesis in tumours :? Tumour stimulates the growth of host blood vessels. Which is essential for supplying nutrients to the tumour. Tumours cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter or thickness unless they are vascularized because the 12 mm zone represents the maximal distance across which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from blood vessels. Angiogenesis of tumour impas two benefits A) Growth of tumour By supplying oxygen and nutrient to tumour cells. Endothelial cells of new blood vessels secrete growth factors which stimulate the growth of adjacent tumour cells. B) Distant metastasis Without access to the vasculature, the tumour cells cannot rapidly spread to distant sites. Tumour associated angiogenic factors :? Tumours secrete ceain factors which induce neovascularization Two most impoant are ? i) Vascular endothelial derived growth factor (VEGF) ii) Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) Steps in the spread of cancer ? Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesis The first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. Detachment of tumour cells Normal cells remain glued to each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) i.e. E cadherin. Normal function of E cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E cadherin. Down regulation of expression of either E cadherins or catenins results in loosening of cells that helps in metastasis. Tumour cell and extracellular matrix interaction Loosened cancer cells attach to ECM proteins mainly Laminin and fibronectin through a special protein integrin. Degradation of ECM Tumour cells overexpress proteases and matrix degrading enzymes i.e., metalloproteinases that includes collagenase and gelatinase. Another protease cathepsin D is also increased in ceain cancers. These enzymes bring about dissolution of extracellular matrix - Firstly basement membrane of tumour itself; is dissolved then it make way for the tumour cells through the interstitial matrix and.finally the basement membrane of the vessel wall is dissolved. Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen :? Tumour cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the following mechanisms play a role. i) Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from tumour cells and stimulate receptor mediated motility of tumour cells. ii) Cleavage product of matrix components. Which are formed following degradation of ECM have propeies of tumour cell chemotcuis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in cancer. After the malignant cells have migrated through the breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen of lymphatic and capillary channels. Thrombus formation The tumour cells protruding in the lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of the circulating blood and form the thrombus. Thrombus provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also prevent them from immune attack. Extravasation of tumour cells Tumour cells in the circulation may mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to vascular end. In this way, the sequence similar to local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane is exposed.", "Correct option": "A"}

Absence of a binding ligand needed to transpo zinc may fuher contribute to zinc malabsorption. Ref: Medscape", "Correct option": "B"}

Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis (Fush's uveitis syndrome) It is a form of anterior and intermediate uveitis. The condition is usually unilateral and chronic in nature and is characterized by a chronic non-granulomatous uveitis and eventually results in iris heterochromia (a change in the colour of iris) The disease has following characteristic features : Heterochromia of iris Diffuse stromal iris atrophy Fine KPs at back of cornea Faint aqueous flare Absence of posterior synechiae A fairly common rubeosis iridis, sometimes associated with neovascularisation of the angle of anterior chamber. Comparatively early development of complicated cataract and secondary glaucoma (usually open angle type). Glaucoma has been repoed in 10-59% of cases. Treatment Fuch's heterchromic uveitis responds variable to steroids and cycloplegics. The complications of long term use of these drugs may at times outweigh their potential benefits. Therefore, treatment with topical steroids is given to iritis which is sufficiently active to require the treatment, otherwise the patient is routinely followed without giving any treatment.

Thus an amino acid with no ionizable R-group would be electrically neutral at this pH. This species is termed a zwitterion.Histidine is a unique amino acid as pKa of its imidazole group permits it at pH 7 to function either as a base or as an acid. A minor change in pH changes the ionization charge on histidine to buffer pH change. Therefore it can serve as a buffer and is most stable at physiological pH.However, when histidine is incorporated into a protein, its side chain can be either positively charged or neutral, depending on the ionic environment provided by the polypeptide chains of the protein.This is an important property of histidine that contributes to the role it plays in the functioning of proteins such as hemoglobin.Extra edge: A tetrahydral carbon atom with four distinct parts is known as chiral.

At least one of the daily attacks of pain recurs at about the same hour each day for the duration of a cluster bout.The typical cluster headache patient has daily- bouts of one to two attacks of relatively short- duration unilateral pain for 8 to 10 weeks a year; this is usually followed by a pain-free interval that averages a little less than 1 year.Patients are generally perfectly well between episodes.Onset is nocturnal in about 50% of patients, and men are affected three times more often than women.Patients with cluster headache tend to move about during attacks, pacing, rocking, or rubbing their head for relief. This is in sharp contrast to patients with migraine, who prefer to remain motionless during attacks.Cluster headache is associated with ipsilateral symptoms of cranial parasympathetic autonomic activation: conjunctival injection or lacrimation, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, or cranial sympathetic dysfunction such as ptosis.The sympathetic deficit is peripheral and likely to be due to parasympathetic activation with injury to ascending sympathetic fibers surrounding a dilated carotid artery as it passes into the cranial cavity.When present, photophobia and phonophobia are far more likely to he unilateral and on the same side of the pain, rather than bilateral, as is seen in migraine.Cluster headache is likely to be a disorder involving central pacemaker neurons in the region of the posterior hypothalamusTreatment:Acute Attack TreatmentOxygen inhalation.Sumatriptan 6 mg SC is rapid in onset and will usually shorten an attack to 10-15 minSumatriptan (20 mg) and zolmitriptan (5 mg) nasal spraysOral sumatriptan is not effective for prevention or for acute treatment of cluster headache.Preventive Treatments (See the following table)Neurostimulation TherapyIndicated when medical therapies failDeep-brain stimulation of the region of the posterior hypothalamic gray matter has proven successful in a substantial proportion of patients.", "Correct option": "C"}

Sulfadoxine + Pyrimethamine * Under the recent 'National anti-Malaria Programme.' the drug policy for malaria treatment is as follows-Any fever in endemic areas during transmission season without any other obvious cause may be considered as malaria and investigated/treated accordingly.Drug resistance foci are prevalent in the country but chloroquine is still the safe, effective and cheap antimalarial drug and is simple to be administered.The best approach in malaria treatment is diagnosis and treatment on the same day.b(Plasmodium falciparum predominant and drug resistance areas)Presumptive treatment of all suspected/clinical malaria cases :Day 1 Tab. Chloroquine - 10 mg/kg body weight (600 mg adult dose)+Tab. Primaquine - 0.75 mg/kg body weight (45 mg adult dose)Day 2 Tab. Chloroquine - 10 mg/kg body weight (600 mg adult dose)Day 3 Tab. Chloroquine - 5 mg/kg body weight (300 mg adult dose)Radical treatment after microscopic confirmation of species :P vivax - Tab. Primaquine 0.25 mg/kg body wt. (15 mg adult does) daily for 5 days.P. falciparum - No further treatment required.In chloroquine resistant p. falciparum cases/areaSingle dose of 25 mg / kg bw tab. Sulfalene / Sulfadoxine and 1.25 gg/ kg body wt. Pyrimethamine combination (3 tabs, adult does) thereafter tab. Primaquine 0.75 mg/kg body wt. These drugs should be given cautiously and not on the same day as both are known to precipitate haemolytic crisis in sensitive cases with G6PD deficiency.In low risk areasPresumptive treatmentDay 1 - Tab. Chloroquine 10mg / kg body weight (600 mg adult does)Radical Treatment after confirmation of speciesP. Vivax - Tab. Chloroquine 10 mg/ kg body wt. single dose and tab. Primaquine 0.25 mg/kg body wt. daily for 5 days.R falciparum - Tab. Chloroquine 10 mg/ kg body wt. plus tab. Primaquine 0.75 mg / kg body wt. single dose.Severe and Complicated malaria - cases are to be hospitalized for treatment.Choice of antimalarial is quinine injection preferably, 10 mg/ kg body wt. I/V drip in5% dextrose saline to be run over 4 hours, 8 hourly. Switch over to oral dose as early as possible and total duration of treatment should be 7 days including both parenteral and oral doses.Injectable form of Artemisinin derivative may be used for severe and complicated malaria only. The recommended injectable dosages are as follows :Artemisinin - 10mg./kg body wt. once a day for 5 days with a double divided does on first day.Artesunate - 1 mg/kg body wt. IM or IV two doses at an internal of 4-6 hours on the first day followed by once a day for 5 daysArtemether - 1.6 mg/kg body wt. IM, two doses at an interval of 4-6 hours on the first day followed by once daily for 5 days.Artether - 150 mg daily IM for 3 days for adults onlyTab.

Hemangiopericytoma is also retro bulbar intraconal lesion. found in adults but is a rare tumor. Moreover owing to its tendency to invade the adjacent tissues, its margins are less distinct than cavernous hemangioma. Rest 2 options i.e. Dermoid and Capillary hemangiomas are primarily extraconal lesions. Cavernous hemangioma Cavernous hemangioma is the most common orbital vascular tumor in adults. Patients are typically middle aged (2nd to 4th decade) Present with slowly progressive painless proptosis Mostly its intraconal (>80%) but may also be extraconal. Cavernous hetnangiomas possess a distinct fibrous pseudo capsule and therefore on CT and MR appear well defined masses. Cavernous hemangioma is easily resectable as it is: - well encapsulated - does not have a prominent aerial supply (in contrast to capillary hemangioma) Capillary hemangioma Capillary hemangiomas occur primarily in infants. The tumor often increases in size for 6 to 10 months and then gradually involutes. Mostly extraconal, commonly occur in superior nasal quadrant. Capillary hemangiomas in and around the orbit may have an aerial supply from either the external carotid or internal carotid aeries. These tumors are capable of profuse bleeding. On CT and MR these lesions appear fairly well marginated to poorly marginated. Hemangiopericytomas Hemangiopericytomas are rare, slow growing vascular neoplasms that arise from the pericytes of Zimmermann, which normally envelop capillaries. About 50% cases are malignant. On CT and MR the orbital hemangiopericytoma, in contrast to cavernous hemangioma, appear less distint owing to its tendency to invade the surrounding tissues. Angiography may differentiate the tumors from cavernous hemangioma, meningioma, and schwannoma. - Hemangiopericytomas usually have an early florid blush - Cavernous hemangiomas show late minor pooling of contrast, or often appear as avascular masses - Meningiomas may show multiple tumor vessels and a late blush - Schwannomas may show no tumor blush. Dermoid Dermoid and epidermoids are the most frequent development cysts of the orbit. They result from the inclusion of ectodermal elements during closure of the neural tube. The dermoid contains one or more dermal adnexal structures such as sebaceous glands and hair folliclels. Dermoids are extraconal lesions. mostly located at the superior temporal quadrant of the orbit. On CT or MR demonstration offat within the lesion is almost diagnostic of dermoid.", "Correct option": "D"}

The WHO's dietary guidelines for calcium differ between countries, with higher intakes usually recommended in places with higher fracture prevalence.

This cluster includes ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis (as in this case). A common feature is a very strong association with the HLA-B27 genotype. Despite some similarities with rheumatoid arthritis, these patients invariably have a negative test result for rheumatoid factor. Urethritis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis can trigger reactive arthritis, another form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Such infection precedes the onset of arthritis, however. There is no relationship between infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and reactive arthritis in individuals testing positive for HLA-B27.

{"input": "Which of the following describes the reflex increase in hea rate with on atrial distension?\nOptions:\nA) J reflex\nB) Bainbridge reflex\nC) Cushing reflex\nD) Bezold Jarisch reflex", "Analysis": "Bainbridge reflex: When the hea rate is slow, intravenous infusions of blood or electrolyte solutions usually accelerate the hea. Both atria have receptors that are affected by changes in blood volume and that influence the hea rate. These receptors are located principally in the venoatrial junctions: in the right atrium at its junctions with the venae cavae and in the left atrium at its junctions with the pulmonary veins. Distention of these atrial receptors sends afferent impulses to the brainstem in the vagus nerves. The efferent impulses are carried from the brainstem to the SA node by fibers from both autonomic divisions. Bezold-Jarisch reflex or the coronary chemoreflex: Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region (eg, juxtacapillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary aery) causes profound bradycardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. It can be elicited by a variety of substances including capsaicin, histamine, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, and veratridine. In human this reflex may be activated: During myocardial ischemia or, reperfusion (thrombolytic therapy) as a result of increased production of oxygen radicals. By agents used as radiocontrast for coronary angiography. It is cardioprotective by producing bradycardia, thus reduce the amount substances get absorbed into the blood Vasovagal syncope has been attributed to activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex J reflex or pulmonary chemoreflex: Because the C fiber endings are close to pulmonary vessels, they have been called J (juxtacapillary) receptors. They are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lung, but they respond as well to intravenous or intracardiac administration of chemicals such as capsaicin. The reflex response that is produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia, and hypotension Oculocardiac reflex: Traction on the extraocular muscles (especially the medial rectus), conjunctiva, or orbital structures causes hypotension and a reflex slowing of the HR, as well as arrhythmias Cushing's reflex: Increased CSF pressure (intracranial pressure) - cerebral aery compressed - CNS ischemia that causes hypoxia and hypercapnia in medulla, which directly stimulates the vasomotor centre - increased BP - baroreceptor mechanisms causes reflex Bradycardia.

{"input": "A 40-year-old man without a significant medical history comes to the emergency room with a 3-day history of fever and shaking chills, and a 15-minute episode of rigor. He also reports a cough productive of yellow-green sputum, anorexia, and the development of right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Shortness of breath has been present for the past 12 hours.

Which feature would most strongly support inpatient admission and IV antibiotic treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA) Recent exposure to a family member with influenza\nB) Respiratory rate of 36/min\nC) Recent sexual exposure to an HIV-positive patient\nD) Purulent sputum with gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain", "Analysis": "Because of the development of effective oral antibiotics (respiratory fluoroquinolones, extended spectrum macrolides), many patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be managed as an outpatient as long as compliance and close follow-up are assured. The CURB-65 score is a validated instrument for determining if inpatient admission (either observation or full admission) is indicated. Factors predicting increased severity of infection include confusion, urea above 19 mg/dL, respiratory rate above 30, BP below 90 systolic (or 60 diastolic), and age 65 or above. If more than one of these factors is present, hospitalization should be considered.This patient's presentation (lobar pneumonia, pleuritic pain, purulent sputum) suggests pneumococcal pneumonia. The pneumococcus is the commonest organism isolated from patients with CAP. Fortunately, Spneumoniae is almost always sensitive to oral antibiotics such as clarithromycin/azithromycin and the respiratory fluoroquinolones. A Gram stain suggestive of pneumococci would therefore only confirm the clinical diagnosis. Exposure to influenza is an important historical finding. Patients with influenza often have a prodrome (upper respiratory symptoms, myalgias, prostrating weakness), but influenza would not cause a lobar infiltrate. Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia can sometimes follow influenza. Acute lobar pneumonia, even in an HIV-positive patient, is usually due to the pneumococcus and can often be treated as an outpatient. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is usually insidious in onset, causes diffuse parenchymal infiltrates, and does not cause pleurisy or pleural effusion. Physical examination signs of consolidation confirm the CXR finding of a lobar pneumonia (as opposed to a patchy bronchopneumonia) and would simply affirm the importance of coverage for classic bacterial pathogens (i.e., pneumococci, H influenzae). Atypical pneumonias (due to Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, or Legionella) are usually patchy and do not usually cause pleural effusion. Currently recommended treatment regimens for CAP cover both typical and atypical pathogens.", "Correct option": "B"}

B: ACTHFree glucocoicoids inhibit ACTH secretion, and the degree of pituitary inhibition is propoionate to the circulating glucocoicoid level. The inhibitory effect is exeed at both the pituitary and the hypothalamic levels. The inhibition is due primarily to an action on DNA, and maximal inhibition takes several hours to develop, although more rapid \"fast feedback\" also occurs. The ACTH-inhibiting activity of the various steroids parallels their glucocoicoid potency. A drop in resting coicoid levels stimulates ACTH secretion, and in chronic adrenal insufficiency the rate of ACTH synthesis and secretion is markedly increased.Thus, the rate of ACTH secretion is determined by two opposing forces: the sum of the neural and possibly other stimuli converging through the hypothalamus to increase ACTH secretion, and the magnitude of the braking action of glucocoicoids on ACTH secretion, which is propoionate to their level in the circulating blood", "Correct option": "B"}

The defective exocrine gland function leads to microobstruction of the pancreas, which results in cystic degeneration of the pancreas and, ultimately, a digestive enzyme deficiency producing malabsorption of nutrients.The defective gene products cause abnormal water and electrolyte transport across epithelial cells, which results in a chronic disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal system, elevated levels of electrolytes in sweat, and impaired reproductive function.In the lungs, retention of mucus occurs.\nChildren with cystic fibrosis have a high incidence of tooth discoloration when systemic tetracyclines are taken during tooth formation. With the advent of alternative antibiotics, the incidence of tooth discoloration is decreasing. The incidence of dental caries in children with cystic fibrosis is low secondary to long-term antibiotic therapy, buffering capacity of excess calcium in the saliva, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. There is a high incidence of mouthÂ  breathingÂ  andÂ  open-biteÂ  malocclusionÂ  associated withÂ  chronicÂ  nasalÂ  andÂ  sinusÂ  obstruction.Â PatientsÂ  with cystic fibrosis may prefer to be treated in a more upright position to allow them to clear secretions more easily.

D: Cervical pap smear checking The levels of prevention: Primordial prevention is prevention of the emergence/development of the risk factors in countries/population in which they have not yet appeared. e.g. obesity and hypeension prevention Primary prevention methods are used before the person gets the disease. Primary prevention aims to prevent the disease from occurring. So primary prevention reduces both the incidence and prevalence of a disease. Encouraging people to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet rays is an example of primary prevention of skin cancer. Secondary prevention is used after the disease has occurred, but before the person notices that anything is wrong. A doctor checking for suspicious skin growths is an example of secondary prevention of skin cancer. The goal of secondary prevention is to find and treat disease early. In many cases, the disease can be cured. Secondary prevention can be defined as action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications. The specific interventions are early diagnosis (e.g. screening tests, case finding programmes) and adequate treatment. Teiary prevention targets the person who already has symptoms of the disease The goals of teiary prevention are: Prevent damage and pain from the disease - Slow down the disease - Prevent the disease from causing other problems (These are called \"complications.\") - Give better care to people with the disease - Make people with the disease healthy again and able to do what they used to do Developing better treatments for melanoma is an example of teiary prevention.

Protein synthesis Process whereby DNA encodes for the production of amino acids and proteins. This process can be divided into two parts:\n1. Transcription\nBefore the synthesis of a protein begins, the corresponding RNA molecule is produced by RNA transcription. One strand of the DNA double helix is used as a template by the RNA polymerase to synthesize a messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA migrates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. During this step, mRNA goes through different types of maturation including one called splicing when the non-coding sequences are eliminated. The coding mRNA sequence can be described as a unit of three nucleotides called a codon.\n2. Translation\nThe ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) that is recognized only by the initiator tRNA. The ribosome proceeds to the elongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes, composed of an amino acid linked to tRNA, sequentially bind to the appropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with the tRNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into polypeptidic sequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA. At the end, a release factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the complete polypeptide from the ribosome. One specific amino acid can correspond to more than one codon. The genetic code is said to be degenerate.", "Correct option": "D"}

Acute pancreatitis causes the release of many digestive enzyme precursors, which are then conveed to the active form in the damaged tissues. These enzymes degrade the adipose tissue around the pancreatic lobules, producing enzymatic fat necrosis. As pa of this process, many free fatty acids are produced that can bind as soaps with extracellular calcium in chemical equilibrium with serum calcium. This will often cause a significant decrease in serum calcium levels. Caseous necrosis is seen in granulomata produced by infection with M. tuberculosis. Coagulative necrosis preserves the outlines of cells in affected tissue. This common type of necrosis is seen in the hea following an infarct. Gangrenous necrosis is massive necrosis associated with loss of vascular supply, and is generally accompanied by bacterial infection.

This drug is a well-established cause of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. These complications are best recognized following long-term use of the agent in inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis and rheumatoid ahritis, although cases have also followed administration for neoplastic diseases. The risk of liver damage depends largely on the dose, duration, and timing of therapy. In prospective studies, up to 25% of patients receiving a cumulative dose of 1.5 to 2 grams over five years have developed fibrosis or cirrhosis. The risk appears to be lessened by weekly, as opposed to daily, administration of the drug, and exacerbated by concomitant obesity or alcohol abuse. Methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity is often clinically silent and, even in advanced disease, can exhibit an indolent clinical course. Evidence of poal hypeension or liver failure can nonetheless develop in some cirrhotic cases and may lead to death or the necessity for liver transplantation.", "Correct option": "A"}

{"input": "Which is true about measurement of BP with sphygmomanometer versus intra-aerial pressure measurements?\nOptions:\nA) Less than intravascular pressure\nB) More than intravascular pressure\nC) Equal to intravascular pressure\nD) Depends upon blood flow", "Analysis": "The reason for this is - \"dissipation of pressure\". When BP is measured by sphygmomanometry, the principle is 'balancing of pressure between the cuff and the brachial aery'. Suppose the pressure in the aery is, say, 100 mm Hg. When the pressure just outside the aery is 100 mm Hg, the aery will be occluded completely, or when the pressure outside the aery becomes just less than 100, the aery will open up and the flow will sta in the aery. However, for pressure just outside the aery to be 100, pressure in the cuff has to be about 106 mm Hg; about 6 mm Hg is dissipated in the intervening tissue (muscle, fat) between the cuff and the aery. Thus, if we are looking for a point at which the aery is just occluded (with aerial pressure being 100), the cuff pressure at which it happens is about 106 mm Hg Hence, by sphygmomanometry, the pressure measured is higher as compared to direct intravascular pressure measurement.", "Correct option": "B"}

The opponent-process theory states that the cone photoreceptors are linked together to form three opposing color pairs: blue/yellow, red/green, and black/white. The Young-Helmholtz theory postulates that the retina contains three types of cones, each with a different photopigment maximally sensitive to one of the primary colors (red, blue, and green). The sensation of any given color is determined by the relative frequency of impulses from each type of cone. Parvocellular ganglion cells receive color-specific signals from the three types of cones and relay them to the brain the optic nerve. Ref: Waxman S.G. (2010). Chapter 15. The Visual System. In S.G.

These aerioles supply blood to endocardium. o During ischemia, adenosine (a local mediator) causes dilatation of resistance aerioles in ischemic area only, tone of resistance vessels of nonischemic area does not change --> increased flow to ischemic area. o Dipyridamole is a powerful coronary dilator; increases total coronary flow by preventing uptake and degradation of adenosine. o It dilates resistance vessels in nonischemic zone as well ----> Dives the already reduced blood flow away from ischemic zone - Coronary steal phenomenon. o It has no effect on larger conducting vessels (contrast nitrates which dilate larger conducting vessels and cause redistribution of blood towards ischemic zone). o Dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation by increasing cAMP (by inhibiting phosphodiesterase) which potentiates PGI, and interferes with aggregation. o It is not useful as an antianginal drug (due to coronary steal phenomenon), but can be used for prophylaxis of coronary and cerebral thrombosis in post MI and post stroke patients as well as to prevent thrombosis in patients with prosthetic hea valve.", "Correct option": "A"}

The tarsal tunnel is bounded superficially by the flexor retinaculum (laciniate ligament). The tibial nerve may be constricted by pressure from without or within this tunnel. Sources of constriction beneath and adjacent to the tarsal tunnel include bone fragments from displaced distal tibial, talar, or calcaneal fractures; tenosynovitis or ganglia of an adjacent tendon sheath; and bone and soft-tissue encroachment in rheumatoid ahritis or ankylosing spondylitis, varicosities, neural tumor (neurilemoma) or perineural fibrosis. Compression of the nerve leads to pain and sensory disturbances over the plantar surface of the foot. The pain may be precipitated by prolonged weight bearing. It is often worse at night and the patient may seek relief by walking around or stamping his or her foot. Paraesthesia and numbness can also be seen. Tinel's percussion test over the posterior tibial nerve may be positive. imaging Studies and Special Tests: Electromyography and nerve conduction studies should be performed but can be normal early in the entrapment. MRI provides excellent visualization of the tarsal tunnel and is indicated if there is suspicion of a space-occupying lesion within the tunnel.

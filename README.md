Medical Questions Answering is a crucial application in the healthcare domain, aiming to provide accurate and timely medical information to
patients and healthcare providers. This program explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-3B model, a powerful pre-trained language model, for Medical Q&A tasks using
supervised learning. Using a large-scale Medbased medical question-answer dataset MedMCQA, fine-tune the Qwen2.5-3B model to
adapt it to the medical domain. In addition, this program
will evaluate the fine-tuned model in popular
medicalQA benchmarks,and compare its performance with state-of-the-art models to verify
its effectiveness.
